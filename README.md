# mlperceptronpy
A selection of Multilayer Perceptron implementations in Python

mlperceptron.py is designed to understand the algorithm.  

mlperceptron_nmpy.py is a more effecient design, but a little more difficult to understand.  It has more functionality such as the ability to dynamically grow individual layers and to normalize inputs to support a range of input values.  It can also automatically scale the output values to a defined range of integers or floats.
